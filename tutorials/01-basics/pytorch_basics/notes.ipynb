    "> **What is AutoGrad?**\n",
    ">> AutoGrad (automatic gradient) is the automatic differentition tool, recording the change history of tensors to follow the changes and apply the chain rule to compute gradients (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Why is the gradient important?**\n",
    ">> As written by Goodfellow et al. (ch. 4.3), deep-learning involves the optimization of an objective function. And so, the gradient allows us to get the direction with the highest rate of change at a specifc point. By then taking the opposite direction (i.e., gradient descent), we can minimize the objective function (also known as the loss function) which results in a relatively good set of parameters.\n",
